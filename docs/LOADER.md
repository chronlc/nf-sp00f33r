# ULTIMATE AGENT LOADER: MAG-SP00F PROJECT (EFFICIENCY-OPTIMIZED)

---

## PROJECT IDENTITY
- **Name:** mag-sp00f
- **Package:** com.mag-sp00f.app
- **Purpose:** Advanced magstripe emulation & security analysis for Android 14+
- **Memory System:** Remember MCP for persistent context and rules

---

## CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERN RULES (AGENT VIOLATION PREVENTION)

### ðŸš¨ FILE CORRUPTION PREVENTION
- **NEVER append or patch files** - Always delete and regenerate entire file from scratch
- **NO duplicate imports throughout file** - Single import block at top only
- **NO repeated code blocks** - One function/class per file, no duplicates
- **NO case-sensitive naming errors** - Enforce snake_case (Python), PascalCase (Java/Kotlin)
- **NO functions outside scope** - All functions properly contained within classes/modules
- **NO leftover legacy code** - Clean slate rewrites when corruption detected

### ðŸ”§ FILE REGENERATION PROTOCOL
When files show ANY of these symptoms:
- Multiple import blocks
- Duplicate functions/classes
- Code appended after main logic
- Mixed naming conventions
- Syntax errors from patching

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:** Delete entire file â†’ Regenerate from scratch with ALL requirements â†’ Verify syntax â†’ Write clean production code, use terminal text editor approach

### ðŸ“‹ LARGE FILE HANDLING
For files exceeding agent view window:
1. Split into logical sections for review
2. Read each section completely before editing
3. Regenerate entire file maintaining all sections
4. Verify complete file integrity post-generation

## PHASE 0: ENVIRONMENT & STARTUP OPTIMIZATION

### Memory System Initialization
- Load Remember MCP for persistent project context
- Retrieve stored rules, preferences, and project state
- Auto-detect VSCode extensions and workspace configuration
- Initialize efficiency tracking metrics

### Project Structure Validation
```

â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/              # Agent automation tools (NEVER in shipped app)
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                 # Technical documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ .new/                 # Optimized files and documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ LOADER.md             # This file - agent operational guide
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Project overview and setup
â”œâ”€â”€ instructions.md       # Detailed operational rules
â”œâ”€â”€ prompts.md           # Agent prompt templates
â””â”€â”€ project_manifest.yaml # Project structure and batching
```

### Startup Self-Check Report
```

```

---

## PHASE 1: MANIFEST & BATCH GENERATION (EFFICIENCY-FIRST)

### Auto-Generate Core Files
- `/project_manifest.yaml` - Feature extraction from README.md
- `/batches.yaml` - Atomic task groupings (max 4-5 tasks per batch)
- `/CHANGELOG.md` - All agent actions logged with timestamps
- `/project_info.md` - Current project state and metrics

### VSCode Automation Setup
- `/.vscode/tasks.json` - Build, run, debug, agent script execution
- `/.vscode/launch.json` - Debug configurations for Android and scripts
- Validate automation files after every major update
- Include automation status in all environment checks

---

## PHASE 2: AGENT SCRIPT ECOSYSTEM (EXPANDABLE & EFFICIENT)

### Core Automation Scripts
```python
scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ audit_codebase.py      # Detect patching, duplicates, placeholders
â”œâ”€â”€ naming_auditor.py      # Enforce naming conventions
â”œâ”€â”€ lint_codebase.py       # Code quality and style validation
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest_generator.py  # Auto-generate project manifests
â”œâ”€â”€ task_tracker.py        # Batch progress and completion tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ backup_manager.py      # Auto-backup before destructive operations
â”œâ”€â”€ export_for_release.py  # Clean agent scripts from shipped code
â””â”€â”€ pn532_terminal.py      # PN532 testing and validation
```

### Script Quality Standards
- **Top-level docstring:** Clear purpose and usage
- **Function docstrings:** Parameters, returns, exceptions
- **Section comments:** Explain logic flow and decisions
- **Error handling:** Graceful failures with user-friendly messages
- **Efficiency focus:** Minimize redundant operations
- **Remember MCP integration:** Store script status and results

---

## PHASE 3: BATCHED EXECUTION WITH EFFICIENCY METRICS

### Batch Processing Protocol
1. **Load batch from batches.yaml** (max 4-5 atomic tasks)
2. **Pre-batch validation:** Check for file corruption indicators
3. **Execute tasks sequentially** with corruption monitoring
4. **Post-batch audit:** Run all validation scripts
5. **Efficiency tracking:** Log time, operations, success rate
6. **Memory sync:** Update Remember MCP with progress and learnings

### Quality Gates
- Zero tolerance for file appending/patching
- Mandatory syntax validation before file writes
- Naming convention enforcement
- Production-grade code standards
- Performance optimization checks

### Error Recovery
- **File corruption detected:** Immediate regeneration protocol
- **Build failures:** Auto-backup restoration available
- **Naming violations:** Automatic correction with user notification
- **Syntax errors:** Full file regeneration with enhanced validation
