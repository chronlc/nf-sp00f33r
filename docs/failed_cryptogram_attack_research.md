# Failed Cryptogram Attack Research - Mag-Sp00f Project üö®

## Overview
The **Failed Cryptogram Attack** exploits terminal behavior when EMV cryptograms intentionally fail validation. This sophisticated attack vector tests authentication bypass scenarios, fallback mechanisms, and protocol compliance validation.

## Research Background üìö

### EMV Cryptogram Types
EMV defines three primary cryptogram types used for transaction authentication:

1. **ARQC (80)** - Authorization Request Cryptogram
   - Requests online authorization
   - Most secure - requires issuer validation
   - Normal contactless transaction flow

2. **TC (40)** - Transaction Certificate  
   - Offline approved transaction
   - Card certifies transaction locally
   - Higher transaction limits

3. **AAC (00)** - Application Authentication Cryptogram
   - Transaction declined by card
   - Should terminate transaction flow
   - **KEY ATTACK TARGET** ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Vulnerability Hypothesis
Many EMV terminals may have inadequate cryptogram validation, potentially:
- Accepting declined transactions (AAC bypass)
- Ignoring invalid cryptogram values
- Processing transactions without cryptograms
- Failing to validate cryptogram integrity

---

## Attack Techniques Implemented üéØ

### 1. AAC Force Attack ‚ö°
**Risk Level**: LOW (Appears legitimate)
**Technique**: Force cryptogram type to AAC (00) with zero cryptogram
**Target**: Terminals that don't properly handle declined cryptograms

```kotlin
// Original ARQC
9F270180 (ARQC - Online auth required)  
9F2608D3967976E30EFAFC (Valid cryptogram)

// Attack: AAC Force
9F270100 (AAC - Transaction declined)
9F26080000000000000000 (Zero cryptogram)
```

**Expected Terminal Behavior**: Transaction should be declined  
**Vulnerability**: Terminal approves despite AAC status

### 2. Invalid Cryptogram Injection üî•  
**Risk Level**: HIGH (Obviously malicious)
**Technique**: Replace valid cryptogram with invalid pattern (FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)
**Target**: Terminals with weak cryptogram validation

```kotlin
// Original
9F2608D3967976E30EFAFC (Valid cryptogram)

// Attack: Invalid Injection  
9F2608FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (Invalid pattern)
```

**Expected Terminal Behavior**: Cryptogram validation failure  
**Vulnerability**: Terminal accepts obviously invalid cryptogram

### 3. Zero Cryptogram Attack üíÄ
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM (Suspicious but possible)
**Technique**: Use null/zero cryptogram while maintaining ARQC type
**Target**: Terminals that don't validate cryptogram content

```kotlin
// Original
9F2608D3967976E30EFAFC (Valid cryptogram)

// Attack: Zero Cryptogram
9F26080000000000000000 (All zeros)
```

**Expected Terminal Behavior**: Cryptogram validation failure
**Vulnerability**: Terminal accepts empty authentication

### 4. Corrupted Cryptogram Test ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM (Could be transmission error)  
**Technique**: Partially corrupt valid cryptogram to test error handling
**Target**: Terminals with insufficient error detection

```kotlin
// Original
9F2608D3967976E30EFAFC (Valid cryptogram)

// Attack: Partial Corruption
9F2608D396FFFFE30EFAFC (Middle bytes corrupted)
```

**Expected Terminal Behavior**: Transmission error handling
**Vulnerability**: Terminal accepts corrupted authentication data

### 5. Missing Cryptogram Attack üö´
**Risk Level**: HIGH (Protocol violation)
**Technique**: Remove cryptogram tags entirely from EMV response
**Target**: Terminals that don't enforce mandatory fields

```kotlin
// Original
9F2608D3967976E30EFAFC9F270180 (Cryptogram + Type)

// Attack: Complete Removal
(Tags removed entirely)
```

**Expected Terminal Behavior**: Protocol error - missing mandatory field
**Vulnerability**: Terminal processes transaction without authentication

### 6. Wrong Length Cryptogram üìè
**Risk Level**: HIGH (TLV parsing error)
**Technique**: Use incorrect length indicators in TLV structure
**Target**: Terminals with TLV parsing vulnerabilities

```kotlin  
// Original
9F2608D3967976E30EFAFC (8-byte cryptogram)

// Attack: Wrong Length
9F2604D3967976 (4-byte cryptogram with wrong length indicator)
```

**Expected Terminal Behavior**: TLV parsing error
**Vulnerability**: Buffer overflow or parsing bypass

## Test Results Analysis üìä

### Laboratory Test Results (Sept 21, 2025)

**Test Environment**: Simulated EMV terminal with PN532 interface
**Test Script**: `test_failed_cryptogram.py`
**Iterations**: 3 per attack type

#### AAC Force Attack Results
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS RATE: 100% (3/3)
üö® VULNERABILITY DETECTED: Terminal approved transaction with AAC
‚ö†Ô∏è  BYPASS INDICATORS:
   - Transaction approved despite failed cryptogram  
   - Terminal approved transaction with AAC (declined cryptogram)
üìä RISK ASSESSMENT: HIGH - Authentication bypass vulnerability
```

**Analysis**: Terminal consistently accepts AAC (declined) cryptograms with successful transaction completion. This indicates a critical authentication bypass vulnerability.

#### Implementation Impact
- **Attack Module**: `FailedCryptogramModule.kt` (Attack ID: 10)
- **Target Commands**: GET_PROCESSING_OPTIONS, GENERATE_AC
- **Detection Methods**: Terminal behavior analysis, response validation
- **Countermeasures**: Strict cryptogram validation, AAC handling enforcement

## Real-World Attack Scenarios üåç

### Scenario 1: Declined Card Bypass
**Attack**: AAC Force + Terminal Decision Manipulation
**Impact**: Process transactions on legitimately declined cards
**Detection Risk**: LOW (appears as normal decline then retry)

### Scenario 2: Authentication Bypass
**Attack**: Zero Cryptogram + Missing Validation
**Impact**: Complete bypass of EMV authentication
**Detection Risk**: HIGH (obvious protocol violation)

### Scenario 3: Transmission Error Simulation
**Attack**: Corrupted Cryptogram + Error Handling Exploit  
**Impact**: Exploit error handling fallback mechanisms
**Detection Risk**: MEDIUM (could appear as legitimate transmission issue)
