####    @sync - AI AGENT SYNC WITH THIS FILE EVERY 10 MINUTES --- NEW VALUE



Sometimes YOU trying so HARD that your CONTEXT becomes out of FOCUS and LOOPED, When that happens STOP, Re-Sync, Restructure, and PROCEED.

DO NOT SAY OR MARK A TASK COMPLETE UNLESS IT IS COMPLETE, SUCCESSFUK and that for definiton is when it says BUILD SUCCESSFUL for instance at the end of a COMPILE, otherwise it would be considered INCOMPLETE and still right then and there it need to be FIXED IMMEDIATLY.

DO NOT APPEND ANY FILES, IF YOU CAN NOT DO A REPLACE STRING, THEN INSTEAD OF APPENDING I WAS THINKING DELETE THE FILE, REGENERATE THE FILE WITH INCLUDED CHANGES, WRITE THE FILE.  THIS WILL STOP THE DUPLICATE METHODS AND WHOLE BAD FILES, IMPORTS ALL OVER, ETC "THE LOOP".  LETS DEVELOPE A TOOL TO DO THIS FOR US MAYBE MORE EFFICIENTLY.

BEFORE IMPLEMENTING ANY FEATURE, ALWAYS CHECK IF IT'S ALREADY IMPLEMENTED USING SEMANTIC_SEARCH OR FILE_SEARCH. DO NOT DUPLICATE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY. SCAN THE CODEBASE THOROUGHLY BEFORE WRITING NEW CODE.

SYNC EVERY 15 MINUTES

FIGURE OUT YOUR NAMING SCHEME FOR THIS PROJECT CASE SENSITIVE MAKE A FILE WITJH ALL METHODS NAME ALL WHATEVER SO ITS ALL UNIFORM THROUGHOUT AND THERE IS NOT LINK LOSS

NO HARDCODED SIMULATIONS ONLY REAL DATA TO SO WE CAN ACTUALLY TEST THE CODE AND HARDWARE.

PROGRAM FEATURE ADDS OR CHANGES
@agent (AFTER COMPLETING A PROGRAM FEATURE ADD OR CHANGE ON THIS LIST MARK IT  COMPLETE SO WE DONT REDO ON A SYNC, SCAN TO MAKE SURE WE HAVENT ALREADY IMPLETEMENTED FEATURE.

✅ COMPLETED: Material3 xml, fragment, nav bottom bar, included mag-spoof.png use for background and splash_boot.
✅ COMPLETED: Uniform naming scheme file created (case-sensitive, all methods/classes/variables uniform throughout project)
✅ COMPLETED: NO HARDCODED SIMULATIONS ONLY REAL DATA - purged fake simulation code from pn532_live_terminal.py
✅ COMPLETED: PN532 DUAL MODE SWITCHING - USB (/dev/ttyUSB0) and Bluetooth HC-06 (/dev/rfcomm1) with runtime switching in EMU menu
✅ COMPLETED: APDU FLOW HOOKS GPO/PPSE - ApduFlowHooks.kt, EnhancedHceService.kt with real EMV data interception and response generation

UI FRONT END TIED TO PYTHON BACKEND, ALL IN ANDROID APK.
ONE OF THE FIRST PHASES I WANT THE NFC COMPONETS DEVELOPED, HCE ANDROID, PN532 -> HC-06 UART BLUETOOTH ADAPTER: SSID "PN532" PIN "1234" MAC: 00:14:03:05:5C:CB, AND PN532 USB SUPPORT.   ALL CAN BE SWITCHED SELECTED IN THE EMU MENU.
THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT I WILL HAVE A PN532 CONNECTED TO THE TERMINAL ON /dev/ttyUSB0, THE SAME ONE YOUR CONFIGURING FOR SO I WANT YOU TO USE IT AS A TERMINAL AND DEBUG AND PEN TEST THE ANDROID HCE (CARD).  CHECK THE  FLOW USE A FEW DIFF STANDARD USA EMV FLOWS.
THE PN532 DRIVER LETS CODE CORRECTLY, LIBNFC or MAYBE FIND US A DRIVER OR JUST LOOK UP THE RAW COMMANDS AND DO IT THAT WAY I THINK ITS LIKE IN_PASSE_TRANSMIT SOMETHING, LET FIGURE IT OUT!
DEVELOP APDU FLOW TO CATCH GPO PPSE BY COMMAND TO HOOK RESPONSE, GENERATE DEFAULT DATA OR RANDOMIZE.
