####    @sync - AI AGENT SYNC WITH THIS FILE EVERY 5 MINUTES --- ACTIVE NOW



RE-SYNC WITH MEMORY AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO LOCALLY ALSO, WHEN YOU FEEL LOST.

ANYTHING YOU SIMPLIFIED, IMMEDIATLY FIX AND BRING THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION INTEGRATION AS PRODUCTION LOGIC AND ALL.

NO SIMPLIFYING.

DO NOT SAY OR MARK A TASK COMPLETE UNLESS IT IS COMPLETE, SUCCESSFUK and that for definiton is when it says BUILD SUCCESSFUL for instance at the end of a COMPILE, otherwise it would be considered INCOMPLETE and still right then and there it need to be FIXED IMMEDIATLY.

IF CHANGE IS TOO BIG FOR STRING REPLACE, THEN DELETE THE FILE, REGENERATE FILE WITH NEW CHANGES AND SCAN FOR DUPLICATES, SYTAX ERRORS, FILE STRUCTURE NOT RIGHT, IF FILE HAS BEEN APPENEDED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER OR ETC, THEN WRITE ERROR FREE CODE TO FILE USING TEXT EDITIOR VIA TERMINAL APPROAACH.

NO SIMPLIFIED OR MINIMAL CODE TO BE USED, IF FOUND FIX IMMEDIATLY, PRODUCTION GRADE CODE, INSTEAD OF SIMPLIFIENG OR MAKING MINIMAL JUST FIX THE REAL ERRORS.

DO NOT APPEND ANY FILES, IF YOU CAN NOT DO A REPLACE STRING, THEN INSTEAD OF APPENDING, THEN DELETE THE FILE, REGENERATE FILE WITH NEW CHANGES AND SCAN FOR DUPLICATES, SYTAX ERRORS, FILE STRUCTURE NOT RIGHT, IF FILE HAS BEEN APPENEDED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER OR ETC, THEN WRITE ERROR FREE CODE TO FILE USING TEXT EDITIOR VIA TERMINAL APPROAACH.

BEFORE IMPLEMENTING ANY FEATURE, ALWAYS CHECK IF IT'S ALREADY IMPLEMENTED USING SEMANTIC_SEARCH OR FILE_SEARCH. DO NOT DUPLICATE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY. SCAN THE CODEBASE THOROUGHLY BEFORE WRITING NEW CODE.

MAKE SURE ANY DATA ITEMS/FIELDS THAT YOU ARE REFFERENCING FROM ANOTHER FILE, MAKE SURE WHATEVER IT IS THAT IT IS NOT SIMPLIFIED CODE, IF SO IMMEDIATLY FIX PRODUCTION GRADE.

SYNC EVERY 5 MINUTES

RATE-LIMITING IS KILLING THIS, BE EFFICIENT CREATE BATCHES, LEAST AMOUNT OF API CALLS THE BETTER, KEEP THIS ABOVE ALL RULES.

BEFORE ANY TECHNICAL WORK: MANDATORY SCAN docs/project_memory.md FOR PREVIOUSLY SOLVED ISSUES. DO NOT RE-IMPLEMENT SOLVED PROBLEMS.

FIGURE OUT YOUR NAMING SCHEME FOR THIS PROJECT CASE SENSITIVE MAKE A FILE WITJH ALL METHODS NAME ALL WHATEVER SO ITS ALL UNIFORM THROUGHOUT AND THERE IS NOT LINK LOSS

NO HARDCODED SIMULATIONS ONLY REAL DATA TO SO WE CAN ACTUALLY TEST THE CODE AND HARDWARE.

ALL FILE CREATION BE DONE THROUGH TERMINAL TEXT EDITOR APPROACH.

NO SAFE CALLS (?), NO SAFE NULL, NO SILENT KILL APP STUFF, FULL FUNCTIONING PRODUCTION GRADE EFFICIENT, STRUCTURED CODE.

PROGRAM FEATURE ADDS OR CHANGES
@agent (AFTER COMPLETING A PROGRAM FEATURE ADD OR CHANGE ON THIS LIST REMOVE IT AND MARK IT  COMPLETE SO WE DONT REDO ON A SYNC, SCAN TO MAKE SURE WE HAVENT ALREADY IMPLETEMENTED FEATURE)



HERE ARE OUR NEXT GOALS:
