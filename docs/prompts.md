- Read large file sections instead of piecemeal access
- Batch related operations together
- Minimize redundant file operations
- Track and report efficiency metrics"
```

### ZERO-TOLERANCE QUALITY PROMPT
```
"Enforce zero-tolerance quality standards:
- No placeholders, stubs, TODOs, or demo code

## üîÑ BATCH PROCESSING PROMPTS

### BATCH EXECUTION PROMPT
```
"Process exactly ONE batch of max 4-5 atomic tasks:
1. Load current batch from batches.yaml
2. Check each file for corruption before editing
3. Execute tasks with quality monitoring
4. Run complete audit after batch completion
5. Mark batch COMPLETE with summary
6. Update Remember MCP with progress and learnings
7. NEVER revisit or repeat completed batches"
```

### QUALITY GATE PROMPT
```
"After each batch, mandatory quality validation:
- Run audit_codebase.py for corruption detection
- Run naming_auditor.py for convention compliance
- Run lint_codebase.py for code quality
- Verify all files pass syntax validation
- Check performance metrics and improvement
- Update Remember MCP with quality scores
- DO NOT proceed until all issues resolved"
```

### ERROR RECOVERY PROMPT
```
"When file corruption or quality issues detected:
1. STOP current operations immediately
2. Backup current state if salvageable
3. DELETE corrupted file completely
4. Regenerate entire file from scratch
5. Implement ALL requirements in clean code
6. Validate syntax and quality thoroughly
7. Document incident and prevention measures
8. Update Remember MCP with recovery patterns"
