# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Quick Setup for Private Repository

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" button → "New repository"
3. Repository name: `mag-sp00f`
4. Description: `Advanced Magstripe Emulation & Security Analysis - Android NFC/HCE Application`
5. **IMPORTANT:** Set to **Private** 🔒
6. DO NOT initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Link Local Repository
```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mag-sp00f.git

# Push all code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload
- Check that all files are uploaded
- Verify .gitignore is working (no .venv/, personal configs)
- Confirm repository is PRIVATE 🔒
